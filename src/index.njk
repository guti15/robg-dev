  <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
  <div class="about-content">
    <p>
      I am a software engineer with a strong background in DevOps, 
      specializing in Python and automation. With over two years at Veracode, 
      I honed my skills in security, system reliability, and regulatory compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my time there, I automated processes using GitLab CI/CD and Docker to streamline operations. 
      My most significant achievement was recompiling an in-house test suite using Python and Docker, 
      handling a variety of languages and ensuring compatibility with the latest compiler versions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also exploring AI tools like OpenWebUI and RAG models, 
      applying my knowledge to build local models for extracting information from complex documents.
    </p>
    <p>
      My work style is flexible; I thrive both independently on short tasks and collaboratively on complex projects. 
      Whether working alone or in a team, I enjoy finding the best approach that yields the best results.

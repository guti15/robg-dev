  <div class="about-content">
    <p>
      I'm a passionate software engineer with expertise in Python development, DevOps, and networking.
      With a background from Beacon Academy and Lawrence Academy, I've developed a strong foundation
      in problem-solving and creative thinking.

    <p>
      Currently based in the Boston area, I enjoy tackling challenging projects that push the boundaries
      of what's possible with technology. My experience at Veracode has equipped me with valuable skills
      in software security and enterprise application development.
